# The first step of creating the 'member_join' functionality is figuring out a way to see when someone joins the
# discord server. So that's what we'll be figuring out first.

# TO DO: Looking at the structure of the client events above, create another client event that is called when a
# member joins the discord server HINT: ctrl+f "on_member_join" in the discord.py API Reference
# https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html

# Make it so whenever someone joins the discord server, a statement is outputted in the terminal.
# (You can simulate someone joining your server by inviting another bot to your server.
# There are tons of sites with tons of bots, just choose one and have them join)
# Here is a link to a site that let's you invite bots to your server: https://top.gg/
